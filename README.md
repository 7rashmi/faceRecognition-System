# Introduction
This project implements a Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV, TensorFlow, MySQL, and Python. The system offers a modern approach to attendance management by leveraging facial recognition technology to accurately track attendance in various settings.
## Features
Facial Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow for recognizing faces in real-time.
Attendance Tracking: Records attendance automatically based on recognized faces.
GUI Interface: User-friendly interface developed using Tkinter for easy interaction.
Database Integration: Stores attendance records in a MySQL database for easy retrieval and management.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included in Python installations)
OpenCV (opencv-python package)
TensorFlow (tensorflow package)
MySQL (with appropriate Python connector, e.g., mysql-connector-python)
Other required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)
